  abstract = {Methodological developments and software implementations are progressing at an increasingly fast pace. The introduction and widespread acceptance of preprint archived reports and open-source software have made state-of-the-art statistical methods readily accessible to researchers. At the same time, researchers are increasingly concerned that their results should be reproducible (i.e., the same analysis should yield the same numeric results at a later time), which is a basic requirement for assessing the results’ replicability (i.e., whether results at a later time support the same conclusions). Although this age of fast-paced methodology greatly facilitates reproducibility and replicability, it also undermines them in ways not often realized by researchers. This article draws researchers’ attention to these threats and proposes guidelines to help minimize their impact. Reproducibility may be influenced by software development and change over time, a problem that is greatly compounded by the rising dependency between software packages. Replicability is affected by rapidly changing standards, researcher degrees of freedom, and possible bugs or errors in code, whether introduced by software developers or empirical researchers implementing an analysis. This article concludes with a list of recommendations to improve the reproducibility and replicability of results.}

This paper examines whether data on observed commuting patterns can replace or supplement gravity-based measures representing the commuting potential at specific locations. We use data from a region in Western Norway,and we find that measures based on observed commuting flows and commuting time cannot replace a gravity-based measure of labour market accessibility. Based on, inter alia, the spatial Durbin estimator we find that measures of observed commuting flows increase the explanatory power of a hedonic house price model.}

  abstract = {ABSTRACT We provide a comprehensive overview of the strengths and weaknesses of different spatial econometric model specifications in terms of spillover effects. Based on this overview, we advocate taking the SLX model as point of departure in case a well-founded theory indicating which model is most appropriate is lacking. In contrast to other spatial econometric models, the SLX model also allows for the spatial weights matrix W to be parameterized and the application of standard econometric techniques to test for endogenous explanatory variables. This starkly contrasts commonly used spatial econometric specification strategies and is a complement to the critique of spatial econometrics raised in a special theme issue of the Journal of Regional Science (Volume 52, Issue 2). To illustrate the pitfalls of the standard spatial econometrics approach and the benefits of our proposed alternative approach in an empirical setting, the Baltagi and Li (2004) cigarette demand model is estimated.},

When a scientific effort fails to independently confirm the computations or results of a previous study, some fear that it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science, while others argue that such an observed inconsistency can be an important precursor to new discovery.about reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light, Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in scientific research.and Replicability in Science defines reproducibility and replicability and examines the factors that may lead to non-reproducibility and non-replicability in research. Unlike the typical expectation of reproducibility between two computations, expectations about replicability are more nuanced, and in some cases a lack of replicability can aid the process of scientific discovery. This report provides recommendations to researchers, academic institutions, journals, and funders on steps they can take to improve reproducibility and replicability in science.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the spatial distribution of economic activities that serve the demands of households within a region. The level of local sector activities is measured by employment per inhabitant. The basic hypothesis relates to how this proportion varies systematically over space for a wide range of geographies, from high values in a city center to low values in areas adjacent to the city center, and asymptotically approaching the average regional level as the distance from the center increases. This defines a curve that we (under quite general conditions) find to be invariant under changes in the spatial residential pattern and the transportation structure. This suggests that relationships of this kind might be a powerful tool in the prediction of regional development.}
