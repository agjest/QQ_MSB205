Springer, New York, 2008, Applied spatial data analysis with R, 2nd edn. Springer, New York, 2013), it is important to present the progress now occurring in representation of spatial data, and possible consequences for spatial data handling and the statistical analysis of spatial data. Beyond this, it is imperative to discuss the relationships between R-spatial software and the larger open-source geospatial software community on whose work R packages crucially depend.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT We provide a comprehensive overview of the strengths and weaknesses of different spatial econometric model specifications in terms of spillover effects. Based on this overview, we advocate taking the SLX model as point of departure in case a well-founded theory indicating which model is most appropriate is lacking. In contrast to other spatial econometric models, the SLX model also allows for the spatial weights matrix W to be parameterized and the application of standard econometric techniques to test for endogenous explanatory variables. This starkly contrasts commonly used spatial econometric specification strategies and is a complement to the critique of spatial econometrics raised in a special theme issue of the Journal of Regional Science (Volume 52, Issue 2). To illustrate the pitfalls of the standard spatial econometrics approach and the benefits of our proposed alternative approach in an empirical setting, the Baltagi and Li (2004) cigarette demand model is estimated.},

  abstract = {Distinguishing substantively meaningful spillover effects from correlated residuals is of great importance in cross-sectional studies. Both forms of spatial dependence not only hold different implications for the choice of an unbiased estimator but also for the validity of inferences. To guide model specification, different empirical strategies involve the estimation of an unrestricted spatial Durbin model and subsequently use the Wald test to scrutinize the nonlinear restriction of common factors implied by pure error dependence. However, the Wald test’s sensitivity to algebraically equivalent formulations of the null hypothesis receives scant attention in the context of cross-sectional analyses. This article shows analytically that the noninvariance of the Wald test to such reparameterizations stems from the application of a Taylor series expansion to approximate the restriction’s sampling distribution. While asymptotically valid, Monte Carlo simulations reveal that alternative formulations of the common factor restriction frequently produce conflicting conclusions in finite samples. An empirical example illustrates the substantive implications of this problem. Consequently, researchers should either base inferences on bootstrap critical values for the Wald statistic or use the likelihood ratio test which is invariant to such reparameterizations when deciding on the model specification that adequately reflects the spatial process generating the data.},
